The second homework of my ASB group.  
A program to convert fasta files in nexus files.

## How to use
This terminal program is very simple do use. All you need is call it with all its arguments. It has 3 arguments. The first argument is the fasta filename,
and the second and the third arguments are respectively the **outgroup** and **ngen** variables of the **MrBayes Block** of the nexus file.

An example how to use:
```
# filename is example.fasta, outgroup is Pocardis and ngen is 200000.
./bio_converter.py example.fasta Podarcis 200000
```
